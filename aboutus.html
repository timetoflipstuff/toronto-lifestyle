                            Zion Adventure Photog is a great blog example because of the way its design mirrors its content. The blog posts provide detailed guidance about specific hikes,
                             as well as useful information about activities such as canyoneering and activities for kids. From the written content within, it’s clear that Arika, 
                             the creator of this adventure photography website, is in-the-know about her field.
                             Other features also make this evident. One of those is the rugged, playful atmosphere of the blog,
                              which uses a green and yellow color scheme to evoke ideas of nature and sunshine. 
                            highlighting her knowledge about the Zion area. By turning her expertise into a business, she’s able to make money blogging.</p>
